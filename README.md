!!! NOTE FROM CREATOR !!!

- This code was created back in 2020-2021 and is not fully representative of my current coding practice. 
For example, type checking is not included here


- This wrapper class is designed to use something similar to rolling code to help secure all remotes. This small amount of protection would help to stop 99% of exploiters attempting this. This also allows for multiple events on a singular remote object, which many games use
